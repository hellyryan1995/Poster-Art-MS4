# Poster Art

Poster Art is an E-commerce business based around selling digital abstract art pieces printed at the highest quality once the order has been made.

Users can choose between a variety of different themed abstract art and what size they want to be printed, if they wish to frame it they can also purchase a frame.

My application features e-commerce functionality, payments using stripe, confirmation emails, CRUD functionality for admin to add blog posts and stock items, and an admin section, for the admin user to access database records.

* for the accessor I have included admin login details in the comment section when submitting the project.

* To test purchase products type 4242 4242 4242 4242
