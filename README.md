# Poster Art

Poster Art is an E-commerce business based around selling digital abstract art pieces printed at the highest quality once the order has been made.

Users can choose between a variety of different themed abstract art and what size they want to be printed, if they wish to frame it they can also purchase a frame.

My application features e-commerce functionality, payments using stripe, confirmation emails, CRUD functionality for admin to add blog posts and stock items, and an admin section, for the admin user to access database records.

* for the accessor I have included admin login details in the comment section when submitting the project.

* To test purchase products type 4242 4242 4242 4242

### Bugs Discovered

* Problem 1 - I wanted to change the price depending on the size, using this code worked but the price wouldnt carry over into the checkout page

```
// Help from Stackoverflow
var basePrice = +($('#price').html()).replace(/[^0-9\.]+/g,"");

$("#id_product_size").change(function() {
  newPrice = basePrice;
  $("#id_product_size option:selected").each(function() {
    newPrice += +$(this).attr('data-price');
  });
  $("#price").html('â‚¬' + newPrice.toFixed(2));
  var itemId = $(this).data('item_id');
  handleEnableDisable(itemId);
  console.log("Base Price", basePrice);
  console.log("New Price", newPrice);
});
```

* Problem 1 - Unfortunatley I didnt have enough time to solve it.
